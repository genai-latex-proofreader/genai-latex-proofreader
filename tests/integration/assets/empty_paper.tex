\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Hello world. This is the introduction to a scientific paper.

\section{Proof of main result}
Because $A$ and $B$, we have $C$. This is the main result of the paper.

\section{More results}
We can also prove more results; since we have established that $C$ holds, we can prove $D$. This is a corollary.
